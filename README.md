technology. Key functionalities include: 
• Updates: Displays a feed of photos with tagged names and relationships in a custom
designed Instagram-like UI. 
• Today: Provides daily activity reminders for better management of daily tasks. 
• Identify: Uses facial recognition to identify people through the phone's camera, enhancing 
patient confidence. 
• Assistant Portal: Allows caregivers to monitor and follow up on the patient's condition.
